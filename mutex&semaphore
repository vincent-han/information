Both of them are similar but not same.
For easy understand, someone said mutex is one particular type of semaphore.
In some cases, that is true, but that can not be truth always.
Those two things have totally different perpose.

[mutex]
MUTual EXclusion is a property of concurrency control,
    which is instituted for the purpose of preventing race conditions;
    it is the requirement that one thread of execution never enter its critical section at the same time
    that another concurrent thread of execution enters its own critical section.

Mutex is used to protect shared resources(data, file, etc..).
it give two APIs takeMutex and releaseMutex.

[semaphore]
Semaphore is variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource
   by multiple processes in a concurrent system.
It is a global valiable but unlike other global valiables.
in OS level, atomic property should be guaranteed.

There are three type of semaphore.
 - counting semaphore
 - binary semaphore
 - mutual exclusive semaphore
